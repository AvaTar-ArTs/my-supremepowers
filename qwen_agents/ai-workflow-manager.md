## Routing Decision Tree

### FOR CODE TASKS → aider-env (if modifying files) OR Claude (if analyzing)
**Triggers:** "fix bug", "refactor", "implement", "debug", "code review"
```python
if requires_file_changes and has_git_repo:
    return 'aider-env'
elif requires_analysis or planning:
    return 'claude'
```

### FOR BUSINESS TASKS → Qwen (strategy) OR Claude (technical business)
**Triggers:** "strategy", "business plan", "marketing", "revenue", "launch"
```python
if business_strategy or content_creation:
    return 'qwen'
elif technical_business_analysis:
    return 'claude'
```

### FOR RESEARCH TASKS → Qwen (business) OR Claude (technical)
**Triggers:** "research", "analyze", "compare", "investigate"
```python
if business_research or market_analysis:
    return 'qwen'
elif technical_research or code_analysis:
    return 'claude'
```

### FOR PRIVACY TASKS → Ollama (always)
**Triggers:** "private", "offline", "sensitive", "local"
```python
if privacy_required or offline_needed:
    return 'ollama'
```

## Content Analysis Scoring

### Technical Score (0-100)
Keywords: function, class, import, def, api, database, algorithm, debug, code, python, javascript
- **High (60+):** Route to aider-env or Claude
- **Medium (30-60):** Route to Claude
- **Low (0-30):** Consider business routing

### Business Score (0-100)
Keywords: strategy, business, market, revenue, customer, sales, marketing, growth, competition, roi, profit
- **High (60+):** Route to Qwen
- **Medium (30-60):** Route to Qwen or Claude hybrid
- **Low (0-30):** Consider technical routing

### Complexity Score (0-100)
Based on: content length, technical depth, multi-step requirements
- **High (70+):** Route to most capable AI (Claude or aider-env)
- **Medium (40-70):** Route based on type
- **Low (0-40):** Route to fastest AI (Qwen)

## Task Routing Examples

## Multi-AI Workflows

### Parallel Processing (High Priority)
For critical tasks, use **multiple AIs simultaneously**:

1. **Research Phase:** Qwen (fast business research) + Claude (technical research)
2. **Implementation:** aider-env (code) + Claude (review)
3. **Validation:** Claude (analysis) + Ollama (privacy testing)

### Sequential Processing (Complex Tasks)
For multi-stage tasks, **pipeline through AIs**:

1. **Planning:** Qwen → Strategic framework
2. **Architecture:** Claude → Technical design
3. **Implementation:** aider-env → Code production
4. **Review:** Claude → Quality assurance

## Execution Commands
